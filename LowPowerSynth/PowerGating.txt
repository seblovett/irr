A comparative Analysis of Coarse-grain and Fine-grain Power Gating for FPGA Lookup Tables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pradeep S. Nair


Power gating reduces leakage power

Coarse grain is better than fine grain. 99% and 81% respecitvely vs no gating at all.


Leakage power is an area of concern. 
Caused by undesirable currents flowing through CMOS when they are scaled down.
Not a problem until smaller than 130nm

Island style FPGAs are prone to leakage.

Looks at leakage of SRAM array of a FPGA LUT, 65nm process.

SRAM in FPGA configures the functionality of the device.

Leakage mechanisms:
- Sub-threshold leakage
voltage applied to gate < threshold. 
leakage current that occues when the transistor is off.
Gets worse with smaller transistors

- Gate-tunneling
leakage current between gate and substrate. 
Worse with decreasing oxide thicknesses 

Fine grain : Each SRAM cell is individually gated.
Coarse grain : Each SRAM block is gated (16 by 1)

Bit about transistor sizing.


Savings of ~67% with power gating on a single cell.

coarse grain ~99% saving
fine grain ~81% saving

Coarse - can turn off the read / write transistors.

Conclusion - turning everything off makes a better power saving... 



Enhanced Leakage Reduction Techniques Using Intermediate Strength Power Gating
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harmander Singh


Exponential increase in leakage power 

Novel power gating approach

Multiple sleep modes, savings aroun 17% 


V_{th} must be reduced with smaller technologies. 
Causes subthreshold current to increase, exponentially dependant on V_{th} [2]
Gate tunneling also increases with thinner oxides [1]

Each technology generation results in 30 times increase in gate leakage [3]

Sleep transistors are added between power rails and module to supress leakage currents in standby mode [4,5]

However, when the module is powered up, large penalty in charging ciruit [11]

Ground bounce also an issue [12,13]

Multiple sleep modes manages the compromise between leakage currents and wake up time.

Circuit for intermediate power saving mode [14]

This paper - power gating circuit that supports operation in multiple intermediate sleep modes.
Each mode represents a different tradeoff between wake-up overhead and leakage savings.

Proposed circuit controls the steady-state virtual ground rail potential by modulating the footer transistor.
Different subtheshold gate voltages, causing different Virtual ground levels. 
Lower Virtual ground - less discharge = quicker wake up but more leakage.

Power gating design for standard-cell-like structured ASICs
-----------------------------------------------------------
Sin-Yu Chen


Structured ASIC used to bridge the power, performance, area and design cost gaps between ASIC and FPGA

As technology scales, leakage becomes a problem.

Power gating is a common method.

Fine grained power gating yeilds 52% leakage power reduction with 8% area and 17% delay overheads

Via-configurable logic blocks (VCLB) methodology, reduce costs compared to ASIC

VCLB architecture employs dual supply voltages and gate sizing to reduce structured ASIC dynamic power. 

Need to control leakage power, but have no control of the transistors.

Power gating is effective [21-28]

Power gating
Header / footer switches.
Fine grained - cells are gated
Coarse - modules are gated

Clusters: power gated cells connected together -> transistor network

An FPGA Architecture supporting dynamically controlled power gating
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A.A.M. Bsoul

Leakage power is important in <90nm technologies on FPGAs

Power gating has been shown to reduce leakage power.

Paper proposes a modificaion to the fabric of an FPGA to enable dynamically controlled power gating, in which logic clusters can be selectively powered down during run time. 


``Dynamic power is dissipated in a circuit when it performs actively. 
Leakage power is dissipated when the circuit is idle''

Leakage power ~22% of power in 90nm FPGA. [6]

Effective way to reduce power - power gating [7]

Performance loss may result due to extra resistance that power switches add.

A Power Gating GALS Interface Implementation
--------------------------------------------
A. Rajakumari


GALS - syncronous blocks may need to wait a long time for data from another block. 
Power gate to reduce leakage.

Asynchronous offers more advantages of higher performance and low power dissipation to synchronous [1,2,3,4]

Async not used due to lack of tools [6]

GALS is a good compromise

Power gating uses sleep transistors
