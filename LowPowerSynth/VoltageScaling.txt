Needs many on chip voltage regulators. 

Algorithms must be efficient and fast. 

Paper proposes Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Voltage and Task Scheduling. 
Saves between 26% and 33% 

Dynamic power and static power have quadratic and exponential relationship to the supply voltage respectively [22]

For dynamic voltage scaling, need many on-chip voltage regulators.

Gentic algorithms to help solve the problem [4]

Scheduler needs to order tasks to maximise efficiency [14]

Algorith that selects voltage modes and decides on execution on priority values based on energy consumption, delays and deadlines [7]

Genetic algo based on energy saving potential and assigns slack time. [14][15]
