Swithching Activity Estimation of FSMs for low power synthesis
--------------------------------------------------------------
Kerttu et al.

Switching activity calculated by the probability when in a state that a state bit will switch

Decision Diagram (DD) data structures are used to do this.

Power reduction of 40% - 90% of estimated power dissiplation.

Switching activity is a main contributor to overall power dissiplation [7]

Method for lower power optimisation [5]

Technique in this paper analyses a net-list of an FSM to work out internal switching activities.

Effictient FSM spanning [1]
Algebraic Decision Diagrams used to allocate state transitions [2] [3]

Significant reduction of power by analysing the FSM by knowing signal properties

Hierarchical and Multiple-Clock Domain High-Level Synthesis for Low-Power Design of FPGA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lhairech-Lebreton, Coussy and Martin

Approach looked at slows down the clock fequency in parts of the design,
decrease the complexity of the clock network
reduce numbers of long wires,
clock-gating

low power consumption has been extensively addressed in ASIC [1-6]

FPGA power consumption related to supply, clock frequency and switching activity [7]

Interconnects dominate power consumption, clock networks are a large part too. [8]

FPGAs typically have one clock domain

Clock to F-Fs is always active, even though this isn't needed. 

Reduce power - reduce number of long wires. Multiple Clock domainas and block based architecture.

This paper looks at low power design of DSP on FPGA using clock frequency scaling, and reducing low-level circuit complexity.
Uses hierarchical high-level synthesis to generate synchronous multiple-clock based architectures. 
Block-based design reduces long wires.

Needs FPGA structure knowledge at the high level

Technology Decomposition for Low-Power Synthesis
------------------------------------------------
Panda and Najm

Power depends on switching activity. 
Exact inputs are not known, makes this difficult.
This paper uses transition density.



Clock Gating and its application to low power design of sequential circuits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clock signals consume 15-45% of the system power [1]

Other efforts - reduced voltage swings, buffer insertion, clock routing [2]

Circuits now include controllable clocks derived from a master clock

- capacitance current



Synthesis of clock gating logic through factored form matching
--------------------------------------------------------------
Inhak Han

CG is defined in the RTL.

Automatic synthesis not very explored.

CG defined in RTL by designer. 

other approach - automatic synthesis of gating functions from the gate-level netlist [1-4]
More convenient, even if defined in RTL as can find functions not specified.

Gating function - the function when the clock should be gated

Group ffs with the same gating function.
Simplification - simplify the function as much as possible (this paper)

Simplification - Use the inverse F' to reduce logic.

Or, utilize the existing logic.

Clock Gating Synthesis of Pulsed-Latch Circuits
-----------------------------------------------
Paik, Han 


Clock gating is a standard way of reducing power.
On RTL or gate level.

Using RTL - load-enable registers are identified and then CG can be applied simply [5]
Requires designer to specify candidate registers.

Gate level - gating function is automatically synthesised [6-8]. 
More general and complements the RTL technique.

Problems include identifying groups of clock gated registers

Resurrecting Infeasible clock-gating Functions
----------------------------------------------
Eli Arbel


Propose two optimization techniques for resurrecting functions not used before due to timing violations or excessive power consumption.

Clock gating is widely used
reduces dynamic power

some clock gating are not beneficial due to the extra circuitry causing timing violations or consuming too much power. 

1) approximation technique for efficiently reducing the size of clock gating functions 
2) clustering algorithm for grouping similar clock gating functions
Produces highly efficient clock gating domains.

Other clock gating algorithms [6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16]
