Swithching Activity Estimation of FSMs for low power synthesis
--------------------------------------------------------------
Kerttu et al.

Switching activity calculated by the probability when in a state that a state bit will switch

Decision Diagram (DD) data structures are used to do this.

Power reduction of 40% - 90% of estimated power dissiplation.

Switching activity is a main contributor to overall power dissiplation [7]

Method for lower power optimisation [5]

Technique in this paper analyses a net-list of an FSM to work out internal switching activities.

Effictient FSM spanning [1]
Algebraic Decision Diagrams used to allocate state transitions [2] [3]

Significant reduction of power by analysing the FSM by knowing signal properties

Hierarchical and Multiple-Clock Domain High-Level Synthesis for Low-Power Design of FPGA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lhairech-Lebreton, Coussy and Martin

Approach looked at slows down the clock fequency in parts of the design,
decrease the complexity of the clock network
reduce numbers of long wires,
clock-gating

low power consumption has been extensively addressed in ASIC [1-6]

FPGA power consumption related to supply, clock frequency and switching activity [7]

Interconnects dominate power consumption, clock networks are a large part too. [8]

FPGAs typically have one clock domain

Clock to F-Fs is always active, even though this isn't needed. 

Reduce power - reduce number of long wires. Multiple Clock domainas and block based architecture.

This paper looks at low power design of DSP on FPGA using clock frequency scaling, and reducing low-level circuit complexity.
Uses hierarchical high-level synthesis to generate synchronous multiple-clock based architectures. 
Block-based design reduces long wires.

Needs FPGA structure knowledge at the high level

How to Transform an Architectural Synthesis Tool of Low Power VLSI Designs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gailhard et al.

Behavioural and Architectural levels are areas of large power saving.

Technology Decomposition for Low-Power Synthesis
------------------------------------------------
Panda and Najm

Power depends on switching activity. 
Exact inputs are not known, makes this difficult.
This paper uses transition density.
