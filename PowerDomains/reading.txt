Power domain management interface: flexible protocol interface for transaction-level power domain management
============================================================================================================
Mbarek et al.


Low power methods: Power gating, adaptive voltage scaling

"power domain represents a group of blocks that share the same primary supply nets"

Low power standards: Common Power Format (CPF) [1] or IEEE1801 [3] known as Unified Power Format (UPF)

Power Management Unit (PMU) controls each power management element

PMU - static or dynamic. 
Dynamic strategies incl. scenario tracking or prediction. Needs info of functional and power state of each component
therefore component need to communicate to PMU. 

Large design dependancy between power-domain-based architecture and PMU operation.

Paper proposes and new power domain management interface for control of power domain states.

Building a structured high-level spec of multi-power domain architecture [5]

Power management can be power controller directed or Operating system directed

Protocol interfaces: 
	Power management bus (PMBus) [11], 
		Focuses on transport and physical layer as well as on the command language to communicate with power converters
	system power management interface (SPMI) [12]
		defines command set and protocol for power management and control traffic
both are enhanced I2C. 

Session-based domain power interface defining protocol and signals between domains and manager [13] - only for wireless sensor networks

Conclusion - inter-power-domain protocol interface. platform independent

Using unified power format standard concepts for power-aware design and verification of systems-on-chip at transaction level
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mbarek et al 2011

Power management is important

Power gating, adaptive voltage scaling, widely used power management techniques

Partition chip into multiple voltage regions, with own supply [1]

UPF defines power-management architecture (set of domains, power switches supply networks) and strategy (legal system power modes and power transitions) 
TL models [4] - faster simulations compared to RTL. verify whole system including embedded software

No power aware TL simulator.

Paper presents a generic methodology to augment a TL-model with power including verification capabilities. 
Early decision making of most energy efficient. 
Mapping of TL hardware architecture to power one, uses UPF concepts.

A Method to Evaluate Power Domain Problems in SoC
-------------------------------------------------
Cetin and Balasinski 2006

Noise can disturb SoC operation. Coupled with low pin count -> need fewer power domains -> more current draw per domain.

approach to evaluate power domain problems in SoC. Multi-level analysis of distribution of total die power



New Power-Efficient FPGA Design Combining with Region-Constrained Placement and Multiple Power Domains
