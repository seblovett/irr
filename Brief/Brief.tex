%Abstract
%\end{abstract}


This Independent Research Review is going to look at the use of low power techniques in synthesis.
This includes, but isn't limited to, Phase Locked Loops for use with frequency domains and power scaling.
The aims of this report are to find out what synthesis techniques, if any, currently exist and how they work.
Initial work will involve learning current low power techniques that are used. 


A lot of research and effort is put into low power design of microprocessors due to the necessity of long battery lives of mobile devices.
It is also key for low power sensors too, as they need to be left alone for a long time. 
Many methods already exist to accomplish this. 
The paper done for this report will be a summary of methods found.
