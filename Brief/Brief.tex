What I'm looking at, what are my objectives.

This Independent Research Review is going to look at the use of analogue low power techniques in synthesis.
This includes, but isn't limited to, Phase Locked Loops for use with frequency domains and power scaling.

The aims of this report are to find out what synthesis techniques, if any, currently exist and how they work.
Initial work will involve learning current low power techniques that are used.
